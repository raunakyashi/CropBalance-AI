# 🌾 CropBalance AI - Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026

### 🚀 Overview
CropBalance AI prevents **"Market Saturation"** in agriculture. By analyzing historical sowing trends and price data using **Azure Machine Learning** (simulated), the system predicts price crashes and warns farmers *before* they plant.

### ⚠️ The Problem
Farmers often suffer financial losses due to "Herd Mentality"—planting crops that had high prices last year. This leads to massive oversupply and price crashes.

### 💡 The Solution
Our AI Agent analyzes:
1.  **Historical Price Data:** High previous prices = High risk of overcrowding.
2.  **Weather Forecasts:** Analyzing rainfall to suggest suitable crops.
3.  **Financial Risk:** Calculating potential loss (e.g., "Estimated Loss: ₹50,000").

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Cloud:** Azure Machine Learning & Azure SQL
* **Interface:** Streamlit
